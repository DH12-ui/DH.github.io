            In 397 AD, in the beautiful Zhangjiajie, the Demon Sect led by the Black Heart Tiger set fire to the
            mountain, poisoned the living beings, and wanted to catch the jade unicorn, the spirit beast of the forest,
            in a vain attempt to enhance internal strength and dominate the martial arts by drinking the blood of the
            unicorn. In order to maintain the peace and tranquility of the forest,
            Rainbow Cat's father joined forces with Blue Rabbit's mother and other seven people,
            seven swords combined, and finally defeated the Black Heart Tiger, but the seven swords were either injured
            or disabled.
            Fifty years later, the Black Heart Tiger led the Demon Sect to make a comeback.
            And the only thing that can stop the Black Heart Tiger is to merge the seven swords again, but at this time,
            except for the father of the rainbow cat, the other six swords have long been scattered and secluded, and
            their whereabouts are unknown.
            In a bloody battle, Rainbow Cat's father was finally outnumbered and died heroically.
            The young hero Red Cat obeyed his father's orders and shouldered the heavy responsibility of saving the
            peace of the forest,
            and went down the mountain in anger to find the other six swords...
